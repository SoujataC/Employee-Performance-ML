    "The analysis of Future Inc. Employee Performance DataSet was given to us as the Data Science Project. The main goal of the project is to find the performance rating of the working employees of the organisation. Each of the parameters like sales, HR, Gender, Department etc are analysed and compared to one another to get a proper understanding of the Employee Performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals of the Project as follows:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Department wise performances\n",
    "2.Top 3 Important Factors effecting employee performance\n",
    "3.A trained model which can predict the employee performance based on factors as inputs. This will be used to hire employees\n",
    "4.Recommendations to improve the employee performance based on insights from analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given data of employees has the 1200 records spread across 28 different categories and its well structured  to perform machine learning models. The Shape of the data is 1200x28. These 28 categories are classified into quantitative and qualitative with 16 qualitative categories & 11 quantitative. Only alphanumerical data is employee ID.  The analysis of the project was done on distribution analysis, correlation analysis and department wide analysis to meet the project goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Classifier is used as the Machine Learning Model in this project which predicted 95.3% accuracy. The numerical features are the most relevant in the model according to correlation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important feature is to find the parameters effecting the performance rating of the employees. Machine Learning model were used to find it, which includes Pre-processing the data and converting the strings into numerical data. ML doesn’t support strings as it is based on Numerical data. The overall project was performed and goals were achieved by using the machine learning model and visualization techniques."
